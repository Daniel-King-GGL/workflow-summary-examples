This repo contains a basic dotnet example library with unit tests for the purpose of evaluating the test result visualisation options of GitHub.

Each option has an associated workflow which does a simple test of the app, passing the results to the third-party for processing.

One unit test is left failing to give a view of how each option displays the test result details in the workflow.

Options presented are:
